Cluedo

The idea of the game is to ask opponents for 3 cards: a murder suspect, a weapon and a room that the murder took place in.

The game starts with your turn. You can choose to make a suspection or an accusation.
You give your input to the console, make sure to write the names as you see them, the input is case-sensitive.

If you are sure about your suspections, you can make an accusation. If the accusation is incorrect, you lose.

The opponents ask random cards that they haven't seen yet. They take turns asking from you and each other.
